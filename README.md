True Visionz Co Website - Ecommerce bootstrap 5 README — TrueVisionzCo Website By: Brittani Jones Project: Bootstrap Web Page for TrueVisionzCo Instructor Presentation Guide

Purpose of My Site This is a creative brand website I made to showcase my business, TrueVisionzCo, using Bootstrap 5. I wanted to mix fashion, art, and my personality into a real e-commerce-style layout while learning how to use Bootstrap’s structure, components, and customization.

What I Used HTML + CSS

Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)

Google Fonts (Unbounded, Outfit)

Bootstrap Icons

Image Carousel

Custom logo, images, and content from my actual business

What I Learned + Implemented

Navigation Bar Used a Bootstrap navbar and replaced the text with my own custom logo icon and name.

Responsive menu that collapses on smaller screens.

Hero Section Created a banner with buttons that link to sections using Bootstrap spacing, alignment, and button classes.

Product Grid Used Bootstrap's grid system with rows and columns to make the product cards responsive.

Added “Sale” badges, line-through prices, and different product cards for my actual artwork.

Product Info Page Made a separate product page using a 2-column layout to show a big image on the left and details on the right.

Styled with a gradient background and icons for ratings.

Carousel Included a Bootstrap image carousel to display different views of the Rick & Morty Jordans (one of my custom products).

Buttons work to scroll through images, and the carousel is responsive.

Linking Between Pages Set up a “View Product” button that links from the homepage to the full product info page. (Shows I know how to make pages connect to each other!)

Custom Fonts + Style I used Google Fonts to give the site more personality.

Adjusted colors, buttons, and layout to match my brand’s vibe (bold, creative, and edgy).

Folder Structure index.html → homepage

rickandmorty.html → full product info page

css/styles.css → custom styles

images/ → all my photos and artwork

Notes I’m still learning, so this was my first time mixing Bootstrap with my own styles.

Some things are basic on purpose so I could show I understand the structure.

I tried to make it match my brand visually while also following Bootstrap layout rules.

The carousel section was something I recieved assistance with— I wanted to make sure I included that to show I could understand how it works.
